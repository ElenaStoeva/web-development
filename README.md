# Server-side Rendered Website

I made this website for my final project for CS 2300: Intermediate Design and Programming for the Web

This website is made to serve the Playful Plants Project at Cornell. It supports two audiences - people who browse the plant catalog to get more information about certain plants and administrators who maintain the catalog by adding, deleting, and updating plant entries in the catalog.

The website is deployed to Heroku and can be accessed through https://ess243-project3.herokuapp.com/
